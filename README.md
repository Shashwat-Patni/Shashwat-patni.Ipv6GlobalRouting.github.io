## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this project was to extend ns-3â€™s native **GlobalRouting** protocol to support **IPv6** while minimizing code duplication from the existing IPv4 implementation. Global Routing is based on the quagga implementation of the OSPF Routing Protocol (RFC 2328) . The original Implementation was designed to work for IPv4


Along the way we faced some obstacles:

One of the main goals was to come up with a way to minimize code duplication.
During the Project we Explored different programing alternatives to the problem, namely static polymorphism vs dynamic vs a hybrid approach. Each Design came with its own Pros and Cons . We felt that Template Meta-Programming offerred the best alternative. The tradeoff between dynamic and Static Polymorphism was runtime Performance vs Compile time Checks and complexity with the code base . We finally decided to go with the Static Route due to its various advantages. 

We actually developed both versions halfway , to better understand each in GlobalRoutings Context. This way we could understand that using Runtime Checks was not good enough for our use case.

Along the way I found and fixed some CRITICAL bugs lurking in the protocol and also added a few performance improvements.

## Features Implemented
- Refactor Ipv4 Implementation of Global Routing To a generic API to allow for the further extention to IPv6
- Handle **link-local addresses** alongside global unicast addresses. Link Local Addresses are not routed by definition but are used as Next Hop entries in the Forwarding Tables for IPv6.  
- Ensure **minimal code duplication** by reusing existing IPv4 logic where possible.  
- Provide **route visualization and printing** functionality.  
- Add **unit tests** to validate correctness of IPv6 routes.
- Handle Non-onlink addresses by asserting when encountering them.
- Handle the route Forwarding Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 for the network 3 Layer

## Milestones

For Phase 1: In order to make GlobalRouting work for Ipv6 , we Refactored the code for the API to a generic Templated base. Fixed Bugs  along the way, developed a Linux Like TraceRoute Functionality for GlobalRouting.

For Phase 2: we Instantiated it for the two address types using Template MetaProgramming. Added Extensive Tests and Documentation.
